## What is infrastructure as code?
For me code infrastructure is all the code that manages a process. I think that infrastructure as code ensures that an application can be easily distributed an in for example docker.

## Why do I think IaC is useful

### Speed of a process
I think IaC is useful because it elimitates manual parts of a process. By eliminating these manual parts a process can be sped up. 

### Concistency
I think that another avantage of IaC is a more concistent process because the code will complete all tasks without any distraction.

## How does Terraform plays a role in IaC?
For my understanding Terraform is a tool that manages the infrastructure in the cloud. Terraform allows for easy allocation of resources to an application which makes it easier to set up an infrastructure.
