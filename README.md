## 1. What is infrastructure as code?
For me infrastructure as code is all the code that manages a process. I think that infrastructure as code ensures that an application can be easily distributed in for example docker. To summarize I think that IaC is the collection of all the code (front end and back end) that helps distributing an application.

## 2. Why do I think IaC is useful
I believe that IaC is useful for two reasons. It can speed up the process of distributing an application and it is consistent in building and distributing this application.

### 2.1 Speeding up a process
I think IaC is useful because it eliminates manual parts of a process. By eliminating these manual parts a process can be sped up. 

### 2.2 Consistency
I think that another advantage of IaC is a more consistent process because the code will complete all tasks without any distraction and always in the same manner.

## 3. How does Terraform plays a role in IaC?
For my understanding Terraform is a tool that manages the infrastructure in the cloud. Terraform allows for easy allocation of resources to an application which makes it easier to set up an infrastructure.
